# AWS Terraform Projects

This repository contains modular and independent Terraform scripts to create essential AWS services. Each directory includes a standalone `main.tf` file to help you provision individual resources easily using the Terraform CLI.

##  Folder Structure

- `ec2/` – Deploy a basic EC2 instance
- `iam_user/` – Create an IAM user
- `s3/` – Create an S3 bucket
- `rds/` – Provision an RDS (MySQL) instance
- `vpc/` – Create a custom VPC
- `eks_cluster/` – Deploy an EKS cluster using Terraform AWS Module

##  Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured (`aws configure`)
- AWS IAM credentials with sufficient permissions to create resources

##  How to Use

Each module is self-contained. Just `cd` into the folder and run Terraform commands.

### Example: EC2

```bash
cd ec2
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


## To destroy the EC2 instance later:

terraform destroy

#Important: Edit the main.tf file before running if you need to customize AMI IDs, regions, instance types, etc.

#Notes
#No variables or backend configuration is used — everything is kept simple and in main.tf.
#EKS and RDS setups may incur costs — review the plan before applying.
#Make sure your AWS CLI session has the right permissions and region set.
